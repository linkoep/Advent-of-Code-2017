# Advent-of-Code-2017

My solutions of this year's [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

My focus here is solving the problems as quickly as I can, without worrying about efficiency, mainly because I have a fair amount of programming homework at the moment which is concerned with efficiency, and I'd rather spend the extra time on that. I may go back and revise some of these solutions in the future.
